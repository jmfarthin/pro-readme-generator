## Usage

To use the README generator, download the source code and install inquirer using npm i inquirer@8.2.4. In the terminal, navigate to the 'Develop' directory and enter npm index.js to run the program. You will be prompted to answer questions pertaining to the content of the README you wish to make. Once you have finished answering the questions, the README will populate in the 'Develop' directory for you to view.
